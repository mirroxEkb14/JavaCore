     * An interface describes only the behavior of an object(methods),
     * but it does not have fields, while an abstract class can have them.
     *
     * An abstract class is inherited(etxends) and
     * an interface is implemented(implements). You can inherit only one class,
     * and implement as many interfaces as you like.
     * An interface can extend other interface/interfaces.
     *
     * Abstract classes are used when descendant class extends
     * basic abstract class()
